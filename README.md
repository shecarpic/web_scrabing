# web_scraping
Challenge 11: Full web-scraping and data analysis project. I've learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. Iâ€™ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
